# MAUD Generative AI Documentation

MAUD supports two SDKs for generative AI models: ChatOpenAI and ChatDatabricks. It is designed from the ground up to be used with a chat based agent and thus doesn't support completion based APIs.

## ChatOpenAI

ChatOpenAI is the default SDK for MAUD. It is a wrapper around the OpenAI Python SDK and supports all of the same features.

## ChatDatabricks

ChatDatabricks is a wrapper around the Databricks AI SDK and supports all of the same features.
