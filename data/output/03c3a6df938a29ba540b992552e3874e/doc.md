OPERATIONS &amp; MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES TEMPLATE

The Operations &amp; Maintenance procedures are written protocols in a document explaining how a public water system is to be operated on a day-to-day basis to ensure public health, safety, and compliance with applicable regulations. The O&amp;M manual is one of a water purveyor’s most crucial documents. In addition to being an important guide for any new staff, the O&amp;M manual assures that the utility is operated in a consistent, safe, efficient manner that satisfies all laws, rules, regulations, and conditions needed to protect public health.

The O&amp;M manual should be prepared in such a way that it could explain to another operator how to run the water system and keep it in compliance. The manual should be individually tailored to each water system’s size, source water, treatment, water quality, distribution system and available resources and should include a complete, practical handbook of the water system’s operation

The O&amp;M manual should be updated regularly, as needed. Once the document is created, it needs to be updated as needed.

Disclaimer

This operations plan template is provided as guidance only.  It contains recognized standards on the types of information that should be contained in an Operations Plan.  Sections of the guidance may not be applicable to every water system and this guidance should be modified to reflect specific conditions at the water system.  A copy of your O&amp;M manual in its entirety must be maintained at your facility and available for review upon request by a representative of the NJ Department of Environmental Protection.

Purpose

This Operations Plan was developed, in part, to satisfy the Licensing of Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment System Operator Regulations, specifically N.J.A.C. 7:10A-1.12 et seq.  This plan contains a detailed system description (source, treatment, storage, and distribution), daily and routine operation and maintenance procedures for the system, in addition to record keeping and emergency response procedures; this plan is intended to ensure that the system operates in a manner that satisfies all laws, rules, and regulations and that all employees are acquainted with their individual responsibilities.

Routine record keeping is accomplished by utilizing the following reports:

- Monthly Operating Report (BSDW-40 or 41)
- Daily Start-up Checklist
- Weekly/Monthly Inspection Report
- Maintenance Activity Report
- Incident/Follow-up Action Report
- Annual Consumers Confidence Report

The Monthly Operating Report (BSDW-40 or 41) is used to maintain daily records of water pumpage, chemical quantities, and routine test results.  This report is submitted monthly by the 10th day of the month following the month for which the records contained in the report are compiled, in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:10A-1.12(d).

A copy of the Daily Start-up Checklist should be kept at the well house and/or treatment plant.  The form should be used to ensure that start-up activities are properly conducted, especially in the event of an emergency when the regular operator is not available. This report is not required to be submitted to the Bureau but should be kept on-site for review upon request.

The Weekly/Monthly Inspection Report can be used to document weekly and/or monthly inspections of mechanical equipment and appurtenances.  Weekly/monthly inspections will ensure that the system is operating properly and in compliance with all applicable rules, regulations, and permit conditions.  This report is not required to be submitted to the Bureau but should be kept on-site for review upon request.

####

The Maintenance Activity Report can be used to document preventative maintenance and testing activities, based on the manufacturer’s recommendations and specifications for equipment.  This report is not required to be submitted to the Bureau but should be kept on-site for review upon request.

####

The Incident/Follow-up Action Report can be used to record follow-up measures taken to correct any deficiencies noted during daily, weekly, or monthly inspections. This report is not required to be submitted to the Bureau but should be kept on-site for review upon request.

The annual Consumers Confidence Report must be delivered to your customers no later than July 1st.  with a copy (can be sent electronically) to the Bureau by July 1st and the CCR Certification Form to the Bureau by October 1st.

Copies of the above reports are filed at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Distribution maps are located at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Technical Manuals are located at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

SECTION 3 – EMERGENCY OPERATION PROCEDURES

This section addresses the protocols (actions and responses) to be followed in the event of an emergency situation or an intervening factor which mandates deviation from routine Operations Plan procedures (power outages, storm/hurricane preparedness, water main breaks, pump failures, accident procedures, on call employee procedures, etc.).

OPTIONAL INSERT (IF APPLICABLE) An Emergency Response Plan was developed for our system on (insert date) in accordance with the Public Health Security Bioterrorism Preparedness &amp; Response Act of 2002, (Public Law 107-188) and the New Jersey Water Allocation Regulations, specifically N.J.A.C. 7:19-11.1 et seq.  This plan details the actions, procedures, and identification of equipment that can be utilized to significantly lessen the impact of an emergency situation.  Due to the confidential nature of our Emergency Response Plan, distribution has been limited to employees as indicated below:

SECTION 5 - WATER QUALITY VIOLATION RESPONSE PROCEDURE

Describe the public notification and repeat sampling, if required, procedure in response to a water quality violation in this section.

Acute violations (such as the confirmed presence of E.coli or an exceedance of the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for Nitrate) must be reported to the NJDEP within twenty-four hours (24) after becoming aware of the violation, in order to ensure appropriate public notification and/or any necessary corrective actions.

NJDEP, Bureau of Safe Drinking Water	(609) 292-5550

NJDEP, Hotline (use after business hours)	(877) WARN DEP [(877) 927-6337]

Non-acute violations (such as an exceedance of the MCL for Inorganics, Volatile Organic Compounds, etc.) must be reported to the NJDEP, Bureau of Safe Drinking Water within forty-eight (48) hours after becoming aware of the violation.

In the case of a MCL, does the lab notify the State?			  Yes    No

In the case of a single sample MCL violation, does

the lab automatically collects check/confirmation samples? 	  Yes    No

Method of Public Notification:  newspaper, posting, hand delivery, other \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
