## Business Problem
Manufacturing, energy, and utility companies have an enormous amount of unstructured documents generated by engineering. These documents contain a mixture of engineering diagrams, drawings, tables, and specific information. Extracting useful information from these documents at scale is the primary challenge this solution addresses. But how do we do this in a landscape with weekly foundation model changes, frameworks evolving at breakneck speeds, and a lack of standardization in how documents are created and stored?

## Proposed Solution
Databricks can help by providing a platform with open data, scaled compute, and a high degree of flexibility when using open source packages and foundation models. This solution accelerator provides an opinionated backbone for multimodal document extraction, search and agent evaluation, and capture of end user feedback. It is an end to end proof of concept for empowering teams to work better with complex engineering documents.

## Reference Architecture
Our solution is divided into four main components: ingest, extract, featurize, and infer. We also use Databricks Apps to provide a basic user inferface for the solution.
